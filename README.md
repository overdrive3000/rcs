# rcs

Nothing super exciting... just my rc files. Move along.

You're welcome to steal from them.

## chezmoi

Migrated from [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to
[chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

The `bootstrap.sh` script will install chezmoi and initialize the repository.

### Ignores

There are some files I currently don't care about but I am leaving around:

* `mac` contains files specific to MacOs
* `udev` contains display hotplug triggers
